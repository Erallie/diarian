Your all-in-one journaling plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

This plugin adds functionality from the [Diarium](https://diariumapp.com/) journal app to the note-taking app we all know and love.

This plugin is *unofficial* to both [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Diarium](https://diariumapp.com/).

<!-- ## Planned features
Being in early development, there are some important features I have yet to add:
- The option to specify how to process -->
## Excluded features
Since this plugin started as a project for my own personal use, there are features present in [Diarium](https://diariumapp.com/) that I do *not* plan on including in this plugin:
- The following views from [Diarium](https://diariumapp.com/):
	- The **Timeline** view
	- The **Map** view
		- I recommend using the [Map View](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-map-view) plugin for this feature. Diarian will automatically use your settings for it.
- Any embedded feeds & events not mentioned in [Included features](#included-features).
- I *may* exclude the ability to insert a location based on your device's current location data.
	- It depends on the feasibility of implementation.
	- The [Map View](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-map-view) plugin can also be used as an alternative for this.
- The ability to lock and encrypt your vault.
	- For those features, I suggest [password](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=password) or [encryption plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=encrypt) from the Obsidian Marketplace like [Protected Note](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=protected-note), [Password Protection](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=password-protection),[^1] or [Lock Screen](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-lock-screen-plugin).[^1]
	- If you sync your vault, [Remotely Save](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=remotely-save) has an option to encrypt your files on the remote location. The files on your local computer will not be encrypted though.

[^1]: [Password Protection](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=password-protection) and [Lock Screen](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-lock-screen-plugin) *only* put a password on your vault or a folder in your vault; they do *not* encrypt or decrypt it.
	
	If you require an encryption feature, browse the Obsidian Marketplace for [plugins with encryption](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=encrypt).

Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/Erallie/diarian/issues) if you'd like me to include any of these features!
# Instructions
## Calendar
Access the **Calendar** view from the context menu that opens after clicking the **ribbon icon**.

![open-calendar](Attachments/open-calendar.png#interface)

The **Calendar** view displays all your daily notes in a calendar layout.

![calendar-view](Attachments/calendar-view.png#interface)

- The number of **dots** ( • ) on a tile represents how many daily notes you have written that day.
- If you have images attached, the first image you attached that day will show up on the tile of that day.

Select the **plus button** ( <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-plus"><path d="M5 12h14"/><path d="M12 5v14"/></svg> ) to create a new note on that day.

![new-note-calendar](Attachments/new-note-calendar.png#interface)

Select a note preview to open it.

![note-preview-calendar](Attachments/note-preview-calendar.png#interface)

### Editor navigation
You can navigate between daily notes from the editor by using the following commands (See [Command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette)):
- **Diarian: Show daily note in calendar**
- **Diarian: Go to previous daily note**
- **Diarian: Go to next daily note**

These commands can also be accessed from the file and editor context menus.

![calendar-navigation](Attachments/calendar-navigation.png#interface)
## On this day
Access the **On this day** view from the context menu that opens after clicking the **ribbon icon**.

![open-on-this-day](Attachments/open-on-this-day.png#interface)

The **On this day** view displays notes written on previous days.

![on-this-day-view](Attachments/on-this-day-view.png#interface)

The interval between days to review (eg. every 3 months) and how long ago to start including notes (eg. 6 months ago or earlier) can be adjusted under **Settings → Diarian → On this day**.

Select a note preview to open it.

![note-preview-on-this-day](Attachments/note-preview-on-this-day.png#interface)
### Notifications
You can optionally receive a notification when there are daily notes from **On this day** to review.

To enable notifications, set **Settings → Diarian → On this day → Notifications** to either **Pop-up modal** or **Notice**.
#### Pop-up modals
Pop-up notifications will appear as a modal when you first open your vault.

![pop-up-notifications.png](Attachments/pop-up-notifications.png#interface)

If dismissed by selecting **Open on this day** or **Ignore**, pop-up notifications will not appear again that day.

If **Remind me later** is selected, the notification will appear again after the chosen duration when your vault is open.
#### Notices
Notice notifications will appear when you first open your vault.

![notice-notifications.png](Attachments/notice-notifications.png#interface)

Notices will remain onscreen until selected.
- Select the link to open the **On this day** view.
- Click or tap elsewhere on the notice to dismiss the notice.
## Importer
Access the **Importer** from the context menu that opens after clicking the **ribbon icon**.

![open-importer](Attachments/open-importer.png#interface)

The **Importer** allows you to import a pre-existing journal from [Diarium](https://diariumapp.com/):
1. Follow the instructions onscreen to export your [Diarium](https://diariumapp.com/) journal to your local files.
2. After they've been exported, choose the exported zip file, and then select **Import**.
### Importer notes
- Entries will be imported to the location specified under **Settings → Daily notes**.
	- If you have multiple entries per day, follow the instructions under [Multiple/nested daily notes](#multiplenested-daily-notes) before importing your journal.
- Attachments will be uploaded to the location specified under **Settings → Files and links → Default location for new attachments**.
- Properties will be populated according to the data exported from [Diarium](https://diariumapp.com/).
	- The **rating** property name can be set under **Settings → Diarian → Rating → Property name**.
	- If [Map View](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-map-view) is installed, the **location** property will use the name set under **Settings → Map View → Settings for the map view plugin. → Key for front matter location**.
	- Each tracker exported from [Diarium](https://diariumapp.com/) will be imported as an individual property.
	- If **How to handle duplicate notes** is set to **Append all new entries**, any existing properties from the new entry will be inserted inside a code block at the beginning of the appended content.
		- I am currently planning to add options to change this behavior in the near future.
## Rating
A rating will appear in the status bar whenever you're viewing a daily note.

![rating-status-bar](Attachments/rating-status-bar.png#interface)

The status bar reads the note properties to determine the rating. If no rating has been set, the status bar will display an empty rating.

To set a rating, do one of the following things:
- Click the rating in the status bar (on desktop).
- Perform the **Diarian: Insert rating** command (See [Command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette)).
- Select **Insert rating** from the file context menu or the editor context menu.
    ![rating-context-menu](Attachments/rating-context-menu.png#interface)

A modal will then open that will allow you to set the rating as you like.

![rating-modal](Attachments/rating-modal.png#interface)
### Customization
Under **Settings → Diarian → Rating**, you can set the **Filled rating item type** and the **Empty rating item type** to use either a Unicode character or emoji, an image of your choice, or an icon from the [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) library.

Here are some hearts that I drew (images):

![rating-images](Attachments/rating-images.png#interface)

Here's something more goth (emojis):

![rating-emojis](Attachments/rating-emojis.png#interface)

And here are some smileys ([Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) icons):

![rating-icons](Attachments/rating-icons.png#interface)
## Timestamp
To insert a timestamp, do one of the following:
- Perform the **Diarian: Insert timestamp** command (See [Command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette)).
- Select **Insert timestamp** from the editor context menu.
    ![timestamp-context-menu](Attachments/timestamp-context-menu.png#interface)

If the active note is from the current day, only the time will be inserted in the timestamp. Otherwise, both the date and the time will be inserted.
## Multiple/nested daily notes
This plugin reads your settings under **Settings → Daily notes** to create new daily notes.
- To create **multiple notes per day**, you must change the **Date format** to include the time within the note name.
- To create **nested daily notes**, change the **Date format** to include **slashes** ( / ) to indicate folders and subfolders.

> #### Format example
> If you create a new daily note when
> - The **Date format** is set to `YYYY/M-MMMM/dddd, Do [at] h.mm A`
> - The current date is August 23, 2024
> - The time is 11:15 AM
> 
> A new note will be created:
> - Named **"Friday, 23rd at 11.15 AM"**
> - In the subfolder **"8-August"**
> 	- Nested under the folder **"2024"**

Once that is done, new notes with the new format will show up in the **Calendar**.
## Date format converter
Access the **Date format converter** from the context menu that opens after clicking the **ribbon icon**.

The **Date format converter** allows you to rename/move pre-existing daily notes to match the format specified under **Settings → Daily notes → Date format** and the folder specified under **Settings → Daily notes → New file location**.
- If you wish to change the format and/or folder of pre-existing daily notes, the above settings should be adjusted *before* using the **Date format converter**.
