- The number of **dots** ( â€¢ ) on a tile represents how many daily notes you have written that day.
- If you have images attached, the first image you attached that day will show up on the tile of that day.

Select the **plus button** ( <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-plus"><path d="M5 12h14"/><path d="M12 5v14"/></svg> ) to create a new note on that day.
