# Calendar
Access the **Calendar** view from the context menu that opens after clicking the **ribbon icon**.

![open-calendar](../Attachments/open-calendar.png)

The **Calendar** view displays all your daily notes in a calendar layout.

![calendar-view](../Attachments/calendar-view.png)

- The number of **dots** ( â€¢ ) on a tile represents how many daily notes you have written that day.
- If you have images attached, the first image you attached that day will show up on the tile of that day.

Select the **plus button** ( <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-plus"><path d="M5 12h14"/><path d="M12 5v14"/></svg> ) to create a new note on that day.

## Editor navigation
You can navigate between daily notes from the editor by using the following commands (See [Command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette)):
- **Diarian: Show daily note in calendar**
- **Diarian: Go to previous daily note**
- **Diarian: Go to next daily note**

These commands can also be accessed from the file and editor context menus.
